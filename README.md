# Investigating the Effect of Reduced Asynchronicity on the Quality of Social Support in Response to Self-Disclosure on Anonymous Online Community Platforms

Read the project paper [here](Evaluating%20Social%20Mechanisms%20-%20Grant.pdf).

A subset of social media platforms that I find particularly interesting is anonymous online community platforms (AOCPs), such as Reddit and Blind. Self-disclosive behavior (Archer, 1980) on AOCPs is often illustrated by what is known as the online disinhibition effect. Suler (2004) posits a number of factors that contribute to the creation of the online disinhibition effect.

I was intrigued to understand how each factor contributes to the benign disinhibition effect on AOCPs. For my experiment, I focused on asynchronicity and how reducing asynchronicity influences the extent of “positive” self-disclosive behavior. To do this, I have designed a social mechanism that reduces the degree of asynchronicity in online (threaded) conversations. I then explore my hypothesis:

"A mechanism that reduces conversational asynchronicity tends to degrade the quality of social support received by participants on an AOCP that implements such a mechanism."
